Implementation of AlexNet for 3D images in Tensorflow

AlexNet is the CNN designed by Alex Krizhevsky for the "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge". The Network had a very similar architecture to LeNet (developed by Yann LeCun in 1990â€™s), but was deeper, bigger, and featured Convolutional Layers stacked on top of each other (previously it was common to only have a single CONV layer always immediately followed by a POOL layer).

Alexnet contained only 8 layers, first 5 were convulational layers followed by fully connected layers. Here I used the same structure, but modified to fit 3D images.
